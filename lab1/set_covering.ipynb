    "### ****PROPOSED SOLUTION FOR THE SET COVERING PROBLEM**** ###\n",
    "***s301247@studenti.polito.it Mohamed Amine Hamdi***\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution is a mix between a beam search, A* and best first algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code alone can be found in ***set_covering_solution.py***\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because to keep track of states to visit next we have a priority queue where optimal states are favorited because the priority function calculates the amount of elements seen and take the unary minus of it and add it to the size of the state, so if a state is optimal it will have priority function 0 and will get chosen as the first candidate, so we aren't going breadth first because if a state is horrible we may never reach the point where the priority queue pops it.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this point I chose a metric of where to stop at each level, this is done because otherwise the problem will explode too much space wise, so to contain it I chose the ***metric*** (0,2,5,10,15,...,etc.), this metric is used so if a state gets a priority of 20 and it is on the third level of the tree we will cut it immediately knowing this solution doesn't provide any good and we save some precious memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The metric seems to be working not too badly but for sure it could be better, I chose this starting testing other solutions(can be checked on the last part of this notebook or in ***other_solutions.py***) and noticing how the optimal solution was growing, so for example the optimal solution with ***N=20*** had weight ***23*** while for ***N=40*** it had weight ***54***, so I tried to approximize how much loss for each level we have usually before finding the optimal solution, obviously this metric works better in some cases than others but for my testing it can generate the optimal solution without exploding in space too much.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "The states are represented as a ***tuple of tuples***, this is done because tuples are immutables like our states and also this gives us theoretically a slight edge on performance with respect to lists, I used tuples also because I wanted to keep track of duplicate states and to do so I needed a hashable data structure without the need to write a hash function for a data structure, the other go to data structure was a set but it lacked this part.\n",
    "\n",
    "A module used all over my implementations is the bisect one, this is because my states are tuples that are always ordered, so two states that have the same sets can be skipped because just doing a simple ***if in frontier or in state_cost*** will get them because the hash will be equivalent, this module helps me inserting in order because it divides the tuple in two and searches for the position recursevely.\n",
    "\n",
    "(In other solutions I used as a state a tuple of numbers representing the sets of integers picked inyo this state, this gave the program a small improvement of memory, but after the use of the metric the space explosion was resolved and so memory was not an issue so I got back to the first implementation of states)"
